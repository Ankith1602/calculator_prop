# Simple Calculator

This is a basic calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %)
- Clear (`ae`) and delete (`de`) buttons
- Responsive design with a simple UI

## Files
- `index.html` - Main HTML file containing the structure of the calculator
- `style.css` (inline within `index.html`) - Basic styles for the calculator layout
- `script.js` (inline within `index.html`) - JavaScript functions to handle user interactions

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
2. Click the buttons to enter numbers and operators.
3. Click `=` to calculate the result.
4. Use `ae` to clear the display.
5. Use `de` to delete the last entered character.

## JavaScript Functions
- `toappends(input)` - Appends a value to the display.
- `todelete()` - Deletes the last character from the display.
- `toclear()` - Clears the display.
- `tocalculate()` - Evaluates the mathematical expression entered.

## Improvements & Fixes Needed
- Fix the `border-radius` issue in input field styling.
- Correct the `size` attribute in the `<h1>` tag (invalid attribute).
- Improve UI for better responsiveness and styling.
- Add error handling for invalid expressions.
